				// The correct one is in another row in the attachments table, as far as I've seen,
				// but the row is not referenced by any other row or table that I can find. I've
				// noticed the correct row has a start_date and transfer_state > 0, and a larger
				// total_bytes. I don't know if that is generally true, though. My best guess is
				// to try to query for a row where the path has the "~/Library" root and the
				// filename suffix, sort by total_bytes DESC, and if there's only 1, then use it?
				// I have not implemented this kind of logic because I'm not sure if we can query
				// the attachments table while we're scanning the messages table, and we'd surely
				// need some locking -- plus I don't even know if the logic is right. I actually
				// looked up the sample above on the original iPhone and sure enough, the image
				// was not found (the message was there, an attachment with that filename showed,
				// but it had no content -- some sort of error or missing data), even though it's
				// clearly referenced in the DB *and* the photo file itself is in the iPhone backup!
