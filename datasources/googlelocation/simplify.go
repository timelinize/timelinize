// A Go implementation of the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker Algorithm.
// Interactive demo and information: https://karthaus.nl/rdp/
//
// Borrowed from github.com/calvinfeng/rdp-path-simplification and
// heavily modified by me.
//
// As explained by Karthaus:
//
//	"The Ramer-Douglasâ€“Peucker algorithm is an algorithm for reducing the
//	number of points in a curve that is approximated by a series of points.
//	It does so by "thinking" of a line between the first and last point in
//	a set of points that form the curve. It checks which point in between
//	is farthest away from this line. If the point (and as follows, all other
//	in-between points) is closer than a given distance 'epsilon', it removes
//	all these in-between points. If on the other hand this 'outlier point'
//	is farther away from our imaginary line than epsilon, the curve is split
//	n two parts:
//
//	1. From the first point up to and including the outlier
//	2. The outlier and the remaining points.
//
//	The function is recursively called on both resulting curves, and the two
//	reduced forms of the curve are put back together."
//
// This implementation was modified to always preserve points that represent
// clusters, which I feel are too important to drop for the purposes of
// simplification. Clusters provide a valuable condensation of information.

		right := simplifyPath(points[idx:], ep)
		return append(left[:len(left)-1], right...)
	}

	// if the most distant point is still too close, then just return the two end points
	return []*Location{points[0], points[len(points)-1]}
}

// seekMostDistancePoint returns the index of the most distant point from the line,
// using perpendicular distance calculation (may not be ideal on a circle...) -- this
// is modified to also return for all cluster points, as we don't want to lose those,
// in that case the maxDist returned will be -1.

	// https://github.com/calvinfeng/rdp-path-simplification/pull/1/

	// instead of starting at 0 and not having the -1)
