Take your timeA caligraphic rendition of the text "Take your time"

            The internet lets us communicate extremely fast, so sometimes we can expect extremely fast responses without realising there's a human, living their own life, at the other end.

            In today's hectic world, friends may want to reach out to friends without making them feel like they owe a fast reply; like writing a postcard.

            Ending any message with "slow.fyi" does just that, because it brings them here, where they can read this message and know a reply is appreciated, not expected.

            Enjoy the internet a little slower today,
            slow.fyi
